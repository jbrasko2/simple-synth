# Simple Synth App
Welcome to the Simple Synth App! This JavaScript-based app allows users to learn and experiment with sound synthesis. The Simple Synth is built using the Tone.js web audio framework to generate sound and the NexusUI for user interface components.

## Usage
The app can be run by visiting https://jbrasko2.github.io/simple-synth-frontend/. Headphones recommended!

Presets can be saved by submitting the preset save form with a required name. The values of the interface will be stored in a Rails-based API to be loaded at a later time.
